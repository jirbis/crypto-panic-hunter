# 🚀 Crypto Panic Hunter™

**Crypto Panic Hunter™** is an experimental AI-powered trading agent that profits from fear in the crypto market. It monitors Bitcoin for sudden drops — moments of panic — and uses those events as signals to buy undervalued altcoins. When the market recovers, it sells them for a profit.

> When others panic, it buys.  
> When the market bounces, it sells.  
> Fully autonomous. Continuously learning. Designed to outperform.
